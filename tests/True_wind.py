# Calculate true winds from vessel speed, course and relative wind
#
# These routines will compute meteorological true winds (direction from
# which wind is blowing, relative to true north; and speed relative to
# the fixed earth).
#
# Created: 12/17/96
# Comments updated: 10/01/97
# Last updated:  4/12/2921
# Developed by: Shawn R. Smith and Mark A. Bourassa
# Programmed by: Mylene Remigio
# Converted to Matlab from C true wind computation code truewind.c .
# Converted to python from Matlab with SMOP 0.1 
# Direct questions to:  samos@coaps.fsu.edu
#
# 9/30/2014 : If the true wind has speed and its coming from the north
#	      then its direction should be 360deg. The problem was fixed
#	      in which the program's output showed 0deg instead of 360deg.
# 8/08/2017 : Converted from Matlab to python by David Pablo Cohn
#             (david.cohn@gmail.com); verified on python 2.7-3.5
# 4/12/2021 : Added a check to ensure the input lists to truewinds() have the
#             same length. Change made by Homer McMillan (hmcmillan@coaps.fsu.edu)

#
# INPUTS
#
# crse	real	Course TOWARD WHICH the vessel is moving over
#			the ground. Referenced to true north and the
#                       fixed earth.
# cspd	real	Speed of vessel over the ground. Referenced
#			to the fixed earth.
# hd	real	Heading toward which bow of vessel is pointing.
#			Referenced to true north.
# zlr	real		Zero line reference -- angle between bow and
#			zero line on anemometer.  Direction is clockwise
#			from the bow.  (Use bow=0 degrees as default
#			when reference not known.)
# wdir 	real	Wind direction measured by anemometer,
#			referenced to the ship.
# wspd	real	Wind speed measured by anemometer,referenced to
#			the vessel's frame of reference.
# wmis	real	Five element array containing missing values for
#			crse, cspd, wdir, wspd, and hd. In the output,
#                       the missing value for tdir is identical to the
#                       missing value specified in wmis for wdir.
#                       Similarly, tspd uses the missing value assigned
#			to wmis for wspd.

# *** WDIR MUST BE METEOROLOGICAL (DIRECTION FROM)! CRSE AND CSPD MUST
#     BE RELATIVE TO A FIXED EARTH! ***

# OUTPUT VALUES:

# tdir	real	True wind direction - referenced to true north
#                       and the fixed earth with a direction from which
#			the wind is blowing (meteorological).
# tspd	real	True wind speed - referenced to the fixed earth.
# adir	real	Apparent wind direction (direction measured by
#			wind vane, relative to true north). IS
#                       REFERENCED TO TRUE NORTH & IS DIRECTION FROM
#                       WHICH THE WIND IS BLOWING. Apparent wind
#			direction is the sum of the ship relative wind
#                       direction (measured by wind vane relative to the
#                       bow), the ship's heading, and the zero-line
#			reference angle.  NOTE:  The apparent wind speed
#			has a magnitude equal to the wind speed measured
#		  	by the anemometer.

# DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT:

# nw	integer		Number of observation times for which tdir and
#                       tspd were calculated (without missing values)
# nwpm	integer		Number of observation times with some values

# FUNCTION truewinds() - calculates true winds for a list of inputs
